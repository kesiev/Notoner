# Notoner tools and assets

## Table database builder

Notoner includes a [base set of table templates](../databases/base/) to peek inside and play with. If you want to add your templates, you can put them [into the custom set](../databases/custom/) or put them [into the extra set](../databases/extras/) if they are coming from someone else - but it's up to you how to manage these sets. Each set contains an [index file](../databases/base/index.json) collecting all table template metadata. To keep it up-to-date, you can run [this script](databases/build.js): it builds all set indexes and prettifies their table JSONs. To do that, go to the script directory and launch it with `node build.js`.

## Table assets

Some sample tables have been generated by scripts or use exported variants of the same master assets. You can find this stuff [here](tables/).

## Self-contained table templates

Notoner save files usually contain the table metadata, the game element definitions, and what has been painted on the sheets. But they can also store game assets, such as sheet templates, custom graphics dice and tokens, and so on - making Notoner save files a good way to _create and share tiny table templates without hosting them on a Notoner server_! To learn more, have a look [here](sample-selfcontained-table/README.md).

## JSON descriptor files quick references

If you need a little help creating your custom Notoner templates or saving files, you may find these quick references handy:

  * [English version](reference/reference-EN.md)
  * [Italian version](reference/reference-IT.md)

## Fonts

If you want to work on Notoner [table templates base set](tables/) assets, make sure you have these fonts installed:

  - [Sentiga](fonts/Stentiga.otf) (by [Typodermic](https://typodermicfonts.com/public-domain/) - [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) Licensed)

## Hacks

### Code review script

[This script](code/review.js) looks for some common transfer issues between elements, save files, and UI by crawling into the code and the table templates. It has been _hacked together_ to help me save time, but it eventually grew into something that keeps [JSON descriptor files' quick references](reference/) up-to-date. I've decided to spare his life and put it somewhere in the project. To run it, go to the script directory and launch it with `node review.js`. [Here](code/config.json) you can find the script configuration file.

### Quicker table template preview

If you're going to develop a new table template, you may need a way to quickly see your changes.

Notoner already allows you to create links to table templates: open the main menu, select the _New table_ option, select a table template from the menu, and then select the _Open in a new tab_ option. For example, this [link](https://www.kesiev.com/notoner/#databases/base/stampadia-chronicles) `https://www.kesiev.com/notoner/#databases/base/stampadia-chronicles` automatically opens today's [Chronicles of Stampadia](https://www.kesiev.com/stampadia/) adventure for you to play.

But I have a trick for you to be _even faster_: add a `!` right after the `#` in the URL to open a table template, skipping the _About_ screen. This [link](https://www.kesiev.com/notoner/#!databases/base/stampadia-chronicles) `https://www.kesiev.com/notoner/#!databases/base/stampadia-chronicles` will do the trick on Chronicles of Stampadia, so you can open your template on a new tab, add the `!` to the URL, work on it, and then refresh the browser page to see your changes.
