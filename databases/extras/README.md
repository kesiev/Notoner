# Table templates extras set

Are you going to host some third-party templates? Add them to this _extra_ table templates directory! Remember to update the [index.json](index.json) file every time you add a new one. To do that automatically, go to [this script](../../assets/databases/build.js) directory and run it with `node build.js`.
